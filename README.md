# Joy Assembler
A minimalistic toy assembler written in C++ by Jonathan Frech, August and September 2020.

# Building
Joy Assembler requires the `C++17` standard and is best build using the provided `Makefile`.

**Build: üü© passing** (2020-09-16T23:36:03+02:00)

# Usage
Joy Assembler provides a basic command-line interface:
````
./JoyAssembler <input-file.asm> [visualize | step | memory-dump]
````
The optional argument `visualize` allows one to see each instruction's execution, `step` allows to see and step thru (by hitting `enter`) execution. Note that the instruction pointed to is the instruction that _will be executed_ in the next step, not the instruction that has been executed. `memory-dump` mocks any I/O and outputs a step-by-step memory dump to `stdout` whilst executing.

# Architecture
Joy Assembler mimics a 32-bit architecture. It has four 32-bit registers: two general-prupose registers `A` (**a**ccumulation) and `B` (o**b**erand) and two special-prupose registers `PC` (**p**rogram **c**ounter) and `SC` (**s**tack **c**ounter).

Along with the above 32-bit registers, whose values will be called *word* henceforth, a single block of 8-bit *bytes* of memory of a fixed size is provided, addressable as either numeric 4-byte words or individual bytes. Each Joy Assembler instruction consists of a _name_ (represented as a singular op-code byte) paired with possibly four bytes representing an _argument_. All instructions' behavior is specified below.

The simulated architecture can also be slightly modified using _pragmas_ (see below).

# Joy Assembler files
Joy Assembler files usually end in a `.asm` file extension and contain all instructions, static data, and other file inclusions that will be executed by the simulated machine. Except for comments, each line contains either an instruction -- to the simulated machine or assembler -- or a piece of data or is left blank. What follows is the documentation of the previously mentioned features.

# Comments
A comment is defined as any characters from a semicolon (`;`) to the end of the line.

One quirk of implementation is that string or character literals cannot contain an unescaped semicolon, as this would be interpreted as a comment. As such, if a semicolon is needed, please resort to either `\u003b`, `\U0000003b` or `\;` (the last one being specially treated whilst removing comments).

# Definitions
To define a constant value, one can use the _definition operator_ `:=`:
````
n := 5
x := 0b00100000
````

# Pragmas
Pragmas are used to alter the simulated machine's fundamental behavior or capability.

# Labels
One can either hard-code program positions to jump to or use an abstraction; _program labels_. A label is defined by an identifier succeeded by a colon (`:`) and accessed by the same identifier preceded by an at sign (`@`). A label definition has to be unique, yet can be used arbitrarily often:
````
ack:
    ; ...
main:
    mov 2
    psh
    mov 3
    psh
    cal @ack
    pop
    ptu
    pop
    hlt
stack:
    data [0xfff]
````

# Data Blocks
A static _data block_ can be defined using `data ..., [optional-size]optional-literal-value, ...` or `data ..., "string-literal", ...`. It defines a statically initialized block of memory. Any numeric literal or string character occupies a word (four bytes), string characters being Unicode-capable:
````
primes:
    data 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 ; ... (finite memory)
global-x:
    data [1]0
global-y:
    data [1]0
buf:
    data [0xff]0xffffffff
msg:
    data "The end is nigh. \u2620\0"
msg2:
    data "I'll say \"goodbye", 0x22, ".", 0b00000000
stack:
    data [0xfff]
````

# Stack
To easily facilitate recursion, Joy Assembler provides native support for a *stack*, that is, a special-purpose region of memory which is usually accessed from the *stack's top* and can grow and shrink. When a stack is desired, its static size has to be specified:
````
stack:
    data [0xfff]
````
A stack is required when using any stack instruction. Stack underflow, overflow and misalignment are strictly enforced. `SC` is initialized with `@stack` when present.

# Instructions
This is the full list of Joy Assembler instructions. Each instruction will be statically loaded into memory using exactly five bytes: a single byte for the instruction's op-code and four further bytes for its arguments, if the instruction allows one, else four zero bytes. When an optional argument is not specified, its default value is used. When an argument is required and not specified or specified and not allowed, an error is reported.

An argument can be specified as either a numeric constant (`0xdeadbeef`, `55`, `0b10001`), a character (`'üê¨'`, `'\U0001D6C7'`), a label (`@main`, `@routine`, `@stack`) or a defined constant.
