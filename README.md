# Joy Assembler
A minimalistic toy assembler written in C++ by Jonathan Frech, August 2020.

# Building
Joy Assembler requires the `C++17` standard and is best build using the provided `Makefile`.

**Build: ðŸŸ© passing** (2020-08-29T20:06:06Z)

# Usage
Joy Assembler provides a basic command-line interface:
````
./joy-assembler <input-file.asm> [visualize | step | cycles | memory-dump]
````
The optional argument `visualize` allows one to see each instruction's execution, `step` allows to see and step thru (by hitting `enter`) execution. Note that the instruction pointed to is the instruction that _will be executed_ in the next step, not the instruction that has been executed. `cycles` prints the number of execution cycles that were performed. `memory-dump` mocks any I/O and outputs a step-by-step memory dump to `stdout` whilst executing.

# Example Programs
Example Joy Assembler programs can be found in the `test/programs` directory. All can be automatically tested using `make test`.

# Architecture
Joy Assembler mimics a 32-bit architecture. It has four 32-bit registers: two general-prupose registers `A` (**a**ccumulation) and `B` (o**b**erand) and two special-prupose registers `PC` (**p**rogram **c**ounter) and `SC` (**s**tack **c**ounter). Regarding memory, a single block of memory of a fixed size is provided, addressable as either numeric 4-byte values or individual bytes. Each Joy Assembler instruction consists of a _name_ paired with possibly four bytes representing an _argument_. All instructions' behavior is specified below.

The simulated architecture can also be slightly modified using _pragmas_ (see below).

# Labels
One can either hard-code program positions to jump to or use an abstraction; _program labels_. A label is defined by an identifier succeeded by a colon (`:`) and accessed by the same identifier preceded by an at sign (`@`). A label definition has to be unique, yet can be used arbitrarily often:
````
ack:
    ; ...
main:
    mov 2
    psh
    mov 3
    psh
    cal @ack
    pop
    ptu
    pop
    hlt
stack:
    data [0xfff]
````

# Data Blocks
A static _data block_ can be defined using `data [optional-size]optional-value, [optional-size]optional-value, ...`:
````
primes:
    data 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 ; ... (finite memory)
global-x:
    data [1]0
global-y:
    data [1]0
buf:
    data [0xff]0xffffffff
stack:
    data [0xfff]
````

# Definitions
To define a constant value, one can use the _definition operator_ ` := `:
````
n := 5
````

# Pragmas
Pragmas are used to alter the simulated machine's fundamental behavior or capability.
